# catalytic-cracking-ML
Data-driven workflows using PCA for optimizing catalytic cracking performance using ML

This repository contains machine learning workflows for catalytic cracking analysis, 
focusing on predicting conversion and gasoline yield. The project explores techniques 
such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k-means clustering, Gaussian Process 
Regression (GPR), Gradient Boosting, and Robust Linear Regression (RLR) with 
Bayesian Optimization.  

## Features
- Preprocessing and feature selection
- Exploratory data analysis with PCA and clustering
- Model training and optimization
- Performance evaluation (RÂ², RMSE, MAE)

## Goal
To assess catalytic cracking performance using data-driven methods, improve interpretability 
of feedstock behavior, and optimize prediction accuracy for industrial applications.
